I need a Chrome Extension that replaces the CSS for a page built in bootstrap to this oDesk-y bootstrap CSS. \n\n#2 - I need you to prototype a page for me in bootstrap, while applying the above theme. We (at odesk) are working on some ideas for the messages section for the site - making it more like skype or slack. (This is all confidential of-course) - I have some initial ideas - and I want a quick prototype to be able to usability test some of the ideas. \n\nI need a page: \n- with a fake oDesk navigation, selected to \"Messages\" tab\n- make some of the menus work, not everything needs to work\n- wireframe: https:\/\/www.evernote.com\/shard\/s251\/sh\/376e34eb-50f5-449e-95c7-a9d8483e793d\/e19bd99254b23d2b838cca68d89b3fff \n- more updated ideas: https:\/\/www.evernote.com\/shard\/s251\/sh\/70c97fe2-a47a-4e6e-9b7b-a9aa9ff03bd0\/db028ce1cb8e3eeb00d55f25f91aa64c\n- https:\/\/www.evernote.com\/shard\/s251\/sh\/6a25e77c-7fc8-48fb-82b4-fb8cbc0b82db\/327b0343b7e6e52872cb9404c00a0355\n\nFeel free to play with it - I am mostly sending you wireframes. I am looking for prototypes where not everything works. I expect that we will start with something very static, and iterate on it a LOT, and add some interactions as we refine it. \n\nLet me know if anything needs more explanation. Looking for task #1 first. \n\nShipra\n\n",
